# Integration Hub API Platform

This repository contains the MVP orchestration API used to prove an end-to-end
consumer-to-provider flow through the Integration Hub. It exposes a stable API
to clients and delegates benefit assessments to the downstream mock benefit
checker.

## API

- `GET /health` - unauthenticated health check
- `POST /v1/benefit-checks/assessments` - authenticated benefit assessment

The assessment response wraps the provider result with a platform request ID:

```json
{
  "requestId": "45e04790-49e1-4fa1-8158-9884f6d451f6",
  "provider": "mock-benefit-checker",
  "assessment": {
    "assessmentId": "6f0804b7-c34b-352d-9dc0-a98e2caadd1d",
    "decision": "ELIGIBLE",
    "matchedEntitlements": [
      {
        "code": "UC-HOUSING-SUPPORT",
        "title": "Universal Credit Housing Support",
        "reason": "Universal Credit claim with income at or below the mock threshold."
      }
    ],
    "riskFlags": [],
    "processedAt": "2026-08-24T12:00:00Z",
    "decisionSummary": "Eligible for 1 mocked entitlement(s)."
  }
}
```

The full request and response contract is in [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml).

## Runtime design

API Gateway authenticates callers and invokes the Python Lambda. The Lambda
validates the public request, forwards it to the downstream API with a
correlation ID, and normalises provider failures into a stable client-facing
error format. Downstream Basic credentials are read from AWS Secrets Manager
and cached briefly; credentials and personal request fields are never logged.

Required Lambda environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `DOWNSTREAM_BENEFIT_CHECKER_URL` | Base URL of the downstream API |
| `DOWNSTREAM_BASIC_AUTH_SECRET_ID` | Secrets Manager secret containing `username` and `password` |
| `DOWNSTREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Optional timeout, default `5` |
| `SECRET_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | Optional credential cache duration, default `300` |

## Develop and package

The Lambda uses only the Python standard library plus `boto3`, which is
provided by the AWS runtime.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
./scripts/package.sh
```

The package is written to `build/benefit-orchestrator.zip`. Terraform remains
in `modernisation-platform-environments`, with this API's infrastructure in the
per-API component
`terraform/environments/integration-hub-api/benefit-checker-api`. Shared
hosting-platform capabilities belong in the separate `platform` component.
The deployment workflow updates the Lambda code after infrastructure has
created it.

## Current downstream contract

The live downstream mock API currently returns:

- `decision` values of `ELIGIBLE`, `REFER_FOR_REVIEW`, or `NOT_ELIGIBLE`
- `matchedEntitlements` as objects with `code`, `title`, and `reason`

The orchestration API forwards that provider payload unchanged inside the
`assessment` wrapper.

## Authentication boundaries

Client credentials are validated by the API Gateway authorizer and are not
forwarded downstream. The orchestration Lambda uses a separate provider
credential from Secrets Manager. A downstream `401` or `403` is returned to
clients as a provider integration failure so internal credentials are not
exposed.
